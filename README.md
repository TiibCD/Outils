# Snippets of code to be used in differents projects.

These snippets are free and sometimes inspired by codes from other users (I always display the link to the github of the creator).
You'll find Java code, arduino code (for wemos especially) ...

Hope it does help you in anyway as it helped me.

Have fun !
